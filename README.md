# â˜• InternPe Internship â€“ Java Domain

This repository contains the tasks completed during my **Java Developer Internship at InternPe**.  
Over the course of the internship, I developed a series of console-based games using **Java and C++**, which helped strengthen my problem-solving, logical thinking, and programming fundamentals.

## ðŸ“‹ Task List & Descriptions

### âœ… Task 1: Guess the Number (Java)
A simple guessing game where the computer generates a random number, and the user has to guess it within a limited number of attempts.  
- Used: `Random`, `Scanner`, `while` loop, `if-else`

### âœ… Task 2: Rock Paper Scissors (Java)
A console-based version of the classic game where the user plays against the computer. The winner is determined based on the standard game rules.  
- Used: `Random`, `Scanner`, `switch`, conditional logic

### âœ… Task 3: Tic Tac Toe (Java)
A two-player terminal game that displays a 3x3 board, takes user inputs alternately, and checks for winning conditions or draw.  
- Used: arrays, loops, and custom methods for game logic

### âœ… Task 4: Connect Four (C++)
A console-based two-player game where players drop tokens into a 6x7 grid. The program checks for four in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.  
- Used: 2D arrays, loops, and conditionals in C++

## ðŸŒŸ My Internship Experience

This internship with **InternPe** provided me the perfect opportunity to apply core programming concepts in a hands-on, project-based format. Each task challenged me to think logically and helped improve my coding structure and problem-solving skills.  
It also boosted my confidence in writing clean, interactive console applications in both **Java** and **C++**.

Iâ€™m truly grateful for this learning experience and look forward to building more real-world projects.
